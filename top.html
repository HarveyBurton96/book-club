                <p>The Duke of Atreides has been manoeuvred by his arch-enemy, Baron Harkonnen, into administering the desert planet of Dune. Although it is almost completely 
                without water, Dune is a planet of fabulous wealth, for it is the only source of a drug prized throughout the Galactic Empire. The Duke and his son, Paul, 
                are expecting treachery, and it duly comes - but from a shockingly unexpected place.
                </p>
                <p>Then Paul succeeds his father, and he becomes a catalyst for the native 
                people of Dune, whose knowledge of the ecology of the planet gives them vast power. They have been waiting for a leader like Paul Atreides, a leader who can 
                harness that force...

                <p>This book contains all the investigations and adventures of the world's most popular detective, Sherlock Holmes. From 'The Adventure of the Gloria Scott' 
                to 'His Last Bow' we follow the illustrious career of this quintessential British hero from his university days to his final case. His efforts to uncover 
                the truth take him all over the world and into conflict with all manner of devious criminals and dangerous villains, but thankfully his legendary powers of 
                deduction, and his faithful companion Dr Watson, are more than up to the challenge.

                <p>Obsessed by creating life itself, Victor Frankenstein plunders graveyards for the material to fashion a new being, which he shocks into life by electricity. 
                But his botched creature, rejected by Frankenstein and denied human companionship, sets out to destroy his maker and all that he holds dear.
                </p> 
                <p>The result of a compact (when Mary Shelley was just nineteen years old) between Mary, her husband Percy and Lord Byron one stormy night to write their own 
                haunting stories, Frankenstein remains essential reading today. Influenced by the myth of Prometheus and Milton’s Paradise Lost, this chilling gothic tale 
                would become the world's most famous work of horror fiction, and continues to be a devastatingly relevant exploration of the limits of human creativity.

                <p>Greece in the age of heroes. Patroclus, an awkward young prince, has been exiled to the court of King Peleus and his perfect son Achilles.
                </p>
                <p>Despite their differences, Achilles befriends the shamed prince, and as they grow into young men skilled in the arts of war and medicine, their bond 
                blossoms into something deeper - despite the displeasure of Achilles's mother Thetis, a cruel sea goddess.
                </p> 
                <p>But when word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, Achilles must go to war in distant Troy and fulfill his destiny.
                </p> 
                <p>Torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus goes with him, little knowing that the years that follow will test everything they hold dear.
